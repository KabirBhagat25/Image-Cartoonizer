# Image-Cartoonizer
Image processing is a rapidly developing branch of computer science that deals with
analysing, manipulating, and interpreting images. It has a wide variety of applications
in various fields such as medical, engineering, entertainment, and security. Image
cartoonization, a subfield of image processing, is the process of transforming digital
images into cartoon-style images, usually with simplified features and exaggerated
representations.
Caricatures have grown significantly in popularity in recent years due to their various
practical uses in entertainment, marketing, and education. In marketing, it can be
used to create unique and eye-catching styles of advertising and promotional
materials. In education, it can be used to create cartoon-style images for teaching
materials such as textbooks and online courses.
The proposed image cartoonizer aims to provide a solution to the challenges
encountered in manually creating cartoon-style images, which are time-consuming
and require considerable artistic skill. Instead, it offers a more efficient and
automated approach to converting digital images into cartoon-style images. This
project uses various image processing techniques such as edge detection,
thresholding, smoothing, blurring and gradient adjustment to produce high quality
cartoon style images. This report provides a detailed overview of the proposed
image cartooning tool, its usefulness, the proposed workflow, and the frameworks
and tools used in its implementation. Implementation results, results, and their
discussion are presented, including the strengths and weaknesses of the proposed
approach and suggestions for future improvements. In addition, the report outlines
each member's contribution to the development of picture cartoonists.
